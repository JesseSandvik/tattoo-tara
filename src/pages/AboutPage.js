            <h2>So ya wanna know a little more about me and my work?</h2>

            <p>
                I was very lucky to have the opportunity to spend time around artists and in my father's tattoo studio, from a young age. I really believe this, amongst other things, helped to shape me into the person and artist I am today.

                At the age of 16, my father, Michael Fenn & stepmom, Lynn Fenn, told me it was time for me to get a job. I gave a lot of thought to what I wanted to do, knowing I didn't have to make a lifelong decision on the spot, but also knowing I wanted to be happy. I didn't want to work with food and wasn't sure I wanted to work in retail either; I soon realized the call of the arts was reaching out to me. So I asked my father to teach me to tattoo. I loved drawing as well as other arts and crafts since a young age, and always felt comfortable in the tattoo studio around the artists I knew growing up, so I hoped and prayed that he would take me on as an apprentice.
                Little did we both know what a life-changing decision that would be, when he decided to teach me to tattoo. Ya see, my father had been in the business for many years already, and in 2003 when I did my first tattoo (which happened to be on my father), the studio, Body Designs ,had already been in business for over a decade. 
                Now, over 16 years later, I am still tattooing and have taken over the business from my father, who retired just a few years ago. 
                What I love most about my job is the reaction of my clients after I have finished bringing their ideas to life. For some, tattoos are done in celebration, some are done in mourning, and some are done just because the client is drawn to the image. Whatever the reason for getting the tattoo done, I am always grateful to be a part of the process. 
                One of the questions I get asked most frequently is "What is your specialty?" and my answer always is "None, I don't want to get bored doing the same style of tattoo day in and day out." This said, there are some styles I do not do, (I will gladly recommend someone who does), and there are some styles and ideas I enjoy doing more than others. Lately I have been a big fan of blackwork, though I still greatly enjoy doing color pieces. 
                As much as I love what I do for a living, tattooing is not my whole life. I also love to travel, spend time with friends, family, my boyfriend and our dogs, cosplay and take part in photoshoots, as well as lift weights, ride my bicycle, dry flowers, listen to podcasts and many other things! Plus, I have officiated several weddings for friends and family, as I am an ordained minister of the Universal Life Church and I'm even a notary (keep that one in mind for your legal needs!).
